# Instruction of the this zip file

- Re_written_cgan.py:
  - The python file I used for the training of Task 1.1
- Change_1.py, change_2.py, change_3.py:
  - These three python files are what I used for the training in the Task 1.2
- Images, images_change1, images_change2, images_change3:
  - Each directory saves three images (10 plot in one figure) during training, and the name of the directory corresponds to the name of python file. There are more than 3 images generated during training but I think it is not necessary to upload all. 
- task2.1_curve, task2.1_smoothed_curve, task2.2_curve, task2.2_smoothed_curve
  - The graph drawn by each subtask of Task 2 is stored in the corresponding directory. 
- Assessment1_sourceCode.ipynb
  - The ipynb file containing the source code of this experiment
- .zip files, Each ZIP file contains 50 images in the last epoch generated from corresponding cgan python file.
